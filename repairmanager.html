                        Managing Repair Services During a Claim
                        <div class="portfolioSubhead">Problem Statement
                            <p class="portfolioText">As part of the transition to create a fully digital claims experience, the customer needed a solution to indicate a need for water clean up services and later how they prefer to get an inspection of their home. What started as a simple form design soon morphed as business requirements shifted and different aspects were re-prioritized.

                            <div class="portfolioSubhead left">Ideation and Design
                                <p class="portfolioText">I started by creating UserZoom studies to gauge customers' sentiment and better emapathize with them when trying to find someone to fix your damaged home.<br><br>The results from the study showed I needed to be sure that insurance jargon was reduced to a minimum to reduce the customer's cognitive load -- how they view the claim process and how the insurer views the process differ greatly.<br><br>On top of keeping up with the changing business partner requirements, this project also challenged me to keep the larger Information Architecture in mind as this project was a small applet wihthin the overarching digital claims flow.

                            <div class="portfolioSubhead right">Results
                                <p class="portfolioText">After many rounds of critique and design, business injects, and development constraints, I put forward a form flow as the best solution.<br><br> While seemingly simple, the flow guides the customer through the initial phase of the claim process and puts them on track to getting back to normal by better explaining what their insurer is going to do for them and where to start.<br><br>User testing showed that customers better understood what to expect next in their claim, who would be contacting them, and what they could do to keep their claim moving forward.
