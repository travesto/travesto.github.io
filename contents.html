                        Taking Inventory After Theft
                        <div class="portfolioSubhead">Problem Statement
                            <p class="portfolioText">When filing a claim for stolen goods, the customer is required to produce a list of belongings that were affected with details such as category, cost, and brand. This used to be accomplished by having the customer send an spreadsheet or numerous emails listing all these details that an adjuster would then have to re-enter into an application that would verify pricing data. Our business partners wanted to create a solution that would allow customers to continuously enter their belongings digitally in one place that would sync seamlessly with the software adjusters use. 
                        </div>
                        <div class="portfolioSubhead">Ideation and Design
                            <p class="portfolioText">Knowing that it's easier to pare down a design than expand at a later date, early iterations embraced the "Pie in the Sky" mantra and included features such as using Amazon's database of products to let customers find their items and have the system prefill the rest of the information. In the end, a simpler solution was created that allows customers to enter as few details as possible to reduce their burden.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="portfolioSubhead">Results
                            <p class="portfolioText">Testing showed this design performs favorably, meets customer expectations and business requirements. During a theft it may be difficult to know immediately what was affected, the simplistic form design allows customers to quickly enter their items and return later if needed.
